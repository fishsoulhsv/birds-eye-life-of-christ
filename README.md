Clarence Larkin created an infographic in 1894 that correlated the geography of Christ's 
life with a harmony of the gospels. There were some differences between what he did and 
what we might commonly accept as the way we see Christ's life today.

#### Map updates since Larkin's:

- Used scan of his original work and completely redrew the map of Israel, updating the 
  accepted boundary of Decapolis.

#### Events update since Larkin's:

- Updated some of the language.
- Categorized _more_ items as miracles than Larkin did.


#### The files:

- The SVG is an Inkscape 1.3.1 SVG file.
- The PDF is an export of the SVG that you can view in your favorite PDF viewer.
